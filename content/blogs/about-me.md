I am a first-generation student born and raised in Chile. I moved to the United States when I was 10 years old and graduated from Stern School of Business at NYU, having studied Finance and Computing & Data Science. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Financial Analysis at the London Business School and pursuing a CFA designation having passed Level 1 in May 2021.

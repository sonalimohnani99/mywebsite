title: Hello! Im Sonali
---

I am a first-generation student born and raised in Chile. I moved to the United States when I was 10 years old and graduated from Stern School of Business at NYU, having studied Finance and Computing & Data Science. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Financial Analysis at the London Business School and pursuing a CFA designation having passed Level 1 in May 2021.

When I am not studying or working, you can usually find me out and about. I love organizing unique activities and outings to do with my family and friends. In fact, my google maps is filled with saved locations that I want to visit and I love to tackle this list. 

I am ambitious and excited for what life has to offer. Upon graduating from London Business School, I will be going back to the United States to pursue a career in Private Equity at Vista Equity Partners.

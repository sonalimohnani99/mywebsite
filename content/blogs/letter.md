description: A Letter I'd Give my Kids

---

Dear Kids,

Your life has only started, and throughout your travels and adventures of plenty you will
grow beyond imagining. You will quickly learn that nothing in life is constant but change, and you
will have to figure out how to navigate it. As your mother, I only wish to leave you with words
you can turn to when in need for guidance. As such, I hope this letter serves you as a summary of
my understanding of awareness as a value, a compendium to turn to at all times. After all, the first
step of understanding not only yourself but the countless, everchanging events and personalities
you will encounter, is to be truly aware of their depth. This does not always come easy, and as
many things are, awareness is a game of trial and error. As such, below you will find a compilation
of tenets to guide you in your own definition of awareness.

**Tenet I:** Don’t Be Deceived by Society’s Definition of Success.
To be aware of who you are is to carve your own path to goals you believe end in success.
As a result, the first tenet to follow in achieving true self-awareness is to rid yourself of
preconceptions imposed onto you by societal norms. Now, this does not mean you should actively
look to marginalize yourself within society led solely by the principle of rebellion. Instead, you
should strive towards understanding the true meaning behind commonly held representations of
success.

Perhaps the best description of this concept comes from Plato’s famous story “Allegory of
the Cave”. In his story, there are a group of prisoners who are chained in a cavern, with only

shadows from the outside world to perceive as reality. Set by social norms, these shadows represent
our egotistical chases at money, fame, and status and trap us into believing that their pursuit will
give us the fulfillment we are so desperately looking for. However, living life in such a manner is
to expect to find the light in chasing shadows; a futile pursuit when the latter only persists when
the former is unseen. The truth is that after a certain basic point, which corresponds to the minimum
poverty level, the happiness you get from increased riches is marginal. As such, by focusing on
these ‘shadows’, or the accumulation of intermediate goods, rather than questioning the truth we
get from them, we bound ourselves to lead a life of unfulfilled mediocracy in ignorance of the light
and beauty that is found outside the cave.

I understand the voice of the crowd can become overwhelming, but you will find the
necessary strength to mute their cries should you to gain awareness of what truly matters to you.
Furthermore, when you face adversity, do not succumb to the judgement of those who are not
aware of the goals you set for yourself, as those that do, are as blind to your success as the cave
dwellers are to the real nature of the world.

**Tenet II**: Follow Your Heart to Give Justice to Your Human Potential
As was the case in understanding your true purpose and the higher values that stand behind
it, there are two other elements in choosing your journey that you must never discount: passion
and emotion. Although the power of intellect and hard work cannot be overstated, it is important
to remember that we are naturally equipped with emotions since the moment of our birth. It is our
heart, more than our intellect, that knows and signals whether we are pursuing the right track in
the right way.

This tenet is one that has withstood the test of time, described in antiquity by Aristotle in
his Virtue Theory. Aristotle notes the inherent morality within us and preaches adherence to our
pious internal moral compass, so that we may develop the appropriate state of character that will
lead us to live a good life and enjoy success. This is vital to feeling fulfilled as it not only matters
if we achieve the goals that we define as success, but also how they are achieved.

Particularly, the more resistance you receive from an undertaking, the more you will get
out of it. Although that is a pretty bold statement, “The economics of happiness” by Bananke,
establishes the distinction between small doses of instant gratification, such as the ‘happiness’
children get from a new toy that they forget about the next day, and the myriad of emotions, good
and bad, that lead to ‘life satisfaction’. In fact, from my experience, satisfaction comes from
accomplishing something really hard, that makes you push your limits and drive yourself to be
better than you were yesterday. Ponder upon what you are ready to struggle for, because nothing
worthwhile will leave you smiling every day, and in fact, might deeply exhaust and frustrate you.
However, in those days when your mind and body are ready to give up, it is your passion and
growth from the journey that will propel you forward.

Moreover, as Steve Job’s said in his 2005 Stanford Commencement Address, “you can’t
connect the dots looking forward, only backwards”. Through your journey, you will find that every
experience, failure or success, will be nothing but a lesson to take with you on your next attempt.
And as mentioned in the “Art of War” by Sunzi, if use these experiences to learn and believe in
yourself, adapt to circumstances, and play the hand you are dealt with, you will be victorious.

**Tenet III**: There is no Authority for Freedom of Choice

Even by being aware of our values and emotions through constant introspection, many times,
there is no escaping conformity unless we wish marginalization. Be it in the form of a single
individual, or a proxy for the voice the people, there is no denying the power attributed to authority.
A great example can be found in conformity experiments, such as the Milgram experiment, which
convinced people to administer electric shocks to fake test subjects. The results concluded that
subjects were willing to inflict pain, even to the extent of killing someone innocent, simply due to
the orders of an authoritative figure.

The results of this controlled laboratory experiment can also be seen 75 years ago, in the
turbulent times of World War II. A massacre, devised by a small group and spread by a single
dictator, was placed on the shoulders of a whole nation, even though it went against all values they
held. It would seem rational a whole nation could stand against the horrific will of one, yet the
power of conformity seems to win the brawl against values no matter the odds. Of course, I do not
wish to impose the terrible acts committed on the conscience of all those subjugated to the will of
Nazi Germany, but to simply alert you to the nature of humans to take the path of least resistance
and to the great ability of the mind to deflect blame away from dearly held values. This deflection
is perhaps the most dangerous aspect of conformity, as it lulls us to the belief that our actions do
not taint our values of empathy and awareness. Therefore, I would ask you to make the unconscious
conscious. I ask you to realize there is no authority that should alter your values and more
importantly, that actions you take under the order of an authority do not shield you from blame.
No matter the difficulty, stride towards acting on your values in defiance of those that seek to
corrupt them. It might seem outlandish, yet throughout history, the winds of change have been
guided by extraordinary people—people that employ their charisma, whit, or ambition to shape
the voice of society. For example, Thoreau’s famous “Civil disobedience” demonstrates this

through his refusal to pay taxes as a demonstration against the Mexican-American War. By doing
this, Thoreau highlighted the idea that causes only derive its power from the majority. All societal
structures that exist must be questioned, otherwise the mistakes we made in history will repeat.

**Tenet IV**: Be Aware of the Unperceived Preconditions of Even the Smallest Parts of Life
As I mentioned in the previous tenet, it is very easy for humans to fall into a pattern of
conformity. In relation to that attribute, it is also very easy to turn a blind eye to the sacrifices those
around you make for the mundane things you take for granted daily, especially with the intense
chains that arise through privilege. This not only means taking note of the support you receive
from those that have attributed to your success, but to take awareness to deeper levels. Similar to
a chain whose strength equals that of the weakest link, our society, and in turn the privileges it
offers you, relies heavily on individuals you might not acknowledge. Having said that, awareness
of these sacrifices is the only hope for meaningful change that will ripple through the hierarchy of
society.

Let me follow up with some examples of what I mean. For many, the biggest issue with
choosing jewelry is the number of karats, that so staunchly grabs attention, leaving none to the
realization that miners must use toxic mercury to separate the gold from the ore. In our lack of
awareness, we unknowingly yield the worth of human lives to shiny rock. If that seems shallow,
compare it to the undertakings of divers in disadvantaged countries, under risk of losing limb and
life, for one lobster course of a gluttonous meal. To act blind, be it friend or a distant link in the

chain of society, is to steal success from the arms of another. Therefore, I urge you to not be tunnel-
visioned, as many others are, and actively seek to understand what we are unknowingly supporting

and what role we have in unjust practices, even when they are dictated by the majority.

**Tenet V**: Become Aware of How You Spend Your Time

As you make goals that align to your values, keep assessing how you invest your time to
accomplish them. As an exercise, I recommend that you make a detailed list of things that you did
yesterday, before you even read this paper, to analyze how you are allocating your time. Doing
this will shine a light to the reality of your current dedication to your objectives.

When I did this exercise, I realized that I am guilty of spending hours scrolling through
social media without even realizing how much time I wasted. In fact, most people fall into this
trap because a lot of newer technology is made with the intent and purpose of consuming our
lives based on an idea called ‘Captology’. Two of my professors at NYU further laid out this
idea in their essay titled “We are slaves to technology”. Specifically, makers of technology have
incorporated psychology to create a “looping cycle: a trigger, a user action, and then a variable
reward that gets the user to invest even more time.” Now, this does not mean that I am against
the use of technology. In fact, I think that when used wisely, technology can be a great tool, and
is many times needed in this day and age, for the purpose of education and outreach.
Furthermore, channeling awareness led me to delete apps on my phone that I was using to
procrastinate my work.
Similarly, I urge you to be aware of how easily distractions can become detrimental to
your goals and to take steps to implement awareness and discipline. Remember that every human
is blessed with limited amount of time on this earth, and it is up to you to decide how you make
use of yours.

**Final Thoughts**

As a final remark to my monologue of lectures, I’d like to leave you with a question
posed in Nietzsche’s “The Eternal Return”, which is that if your life became an “eternal
hourglass of existence that is turned upside down again and again...Would you curse the demon
who spoke thus?” Revisit this question every so often so that you take actions that leave you
proud of who you are and fulfill your soul. Most importantly, remember that jobs disappear,
money is spent, and fame fades away. What stays are your values, your courage, your memories,
and your ability to make an impact. Nobody and nothing can ever take that away from you,
except for if you choose to shroud them in the deafening and blinding might of unawareness.

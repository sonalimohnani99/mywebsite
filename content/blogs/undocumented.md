title: My Undocumented Journey
---

I am a Spanish, Chilean, and Indian passport holder. Yet, for 11 years of my life, I lived where I had no clear path to citizenship. When I was 10, my parents sent me to New York to live with my sister, who is a US Citizen, to receive a superior education. However, at the age of 14 my parents made me aware that I had overstayed my visa and was living in America undocumented. 

The news was difficult to bear on its own, yet was only made tougher when I turned 15 and had to care for myself as my sister left for college and my parents managed their business in Chile. During this period, I lived through the Trump Election, a time when I heard my own school mates yelling “This is what we are going to do to all the illegal immigrants that cross our border!” spiking a volleyball across the net during gym class. Every time my family traveled, I had to stay back in the U.S. because leaving would trigger a 10 year ban from the country. I didn't have a form of ID and had no way of getting a drivers licence so I had to lie to my friends and say I was "too lazy" to get one.  

But out of all these obstacles, not being able to work was the toughest one. I worked so hard to make all of these sacrifices worth it, graduating from one of the top business schools in the U.S. However, none of it seemed to matter. A number of great opportunities came my way. Everyone wanted to work for "The Goldman Sachs" and I had an offer letter sitting in my inbox that I had to decline solely based on my inability to obtain work authorization. 

Why did I put myself through that? And do I regret it? To be honest, a lot of it was not conscious decision-making. I was a baby when I became undocumented, and my parents truly believed that was what was best for me. Although things could have been done differently, they just didn't know better and wanted desperately to give me an upbringing that they never got. Every obstacle I faced during these times had an integral part in my development as an individual, as it only made a tougher person and a more diligent worker. 

I am 22 years old and have seen more lawyers than people see in their lifetime. I took my case into my own hands and after taking a chance and going against my parents judgement, I left the U.S. triggering a 10 year ban and applying for a pardon. I am blessed to say that this pardon has been approved and I now have an appointment with the U.S. embassy to get my green card. 

What got me through this, is that I never lost faith in my ability to advance and bring about change no matter the boundaries that were set upon me. I have a job lined up at my dream company, I am traveling around Europe and finally getting to see the world, and have pretty interesting stories to tell. So no, I wouldn't change anything about this journey. Everything happens for a reason, and this was my path to learn and grow as an individual.
